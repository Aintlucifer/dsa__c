Design and implement a virtual Mastermind game (also called cows and bulls game): The computer generates a 4 digit random number M that is not shown to the player (end user). The player guesses the number. If a guessed digit is present in M and is in the correct position, it is a 'bull' or 'B'. If a guessed digit is present in M but not in the correct position, it is a 'cow' or 'C'. Nothing is mentioned for the guessed digit that is not present in M. When the player guesses the number, system responds with the number of bulls and cows. Example, suppose the random generated number is 2345, and the player has guessed 2468, then the system responds with 1 bull and 1 cow or 1B & 1C. Player makes a second guess 1234, system responds with 3C or 3 cows. The game finishes when the player guesses the number correctly (that is, 4 bulls or 4B) or number of tries reaches 10. If player isn't able to guess within 10 tries, then the system responds with - Sorry, you lose! If the player guesses the number correctly within 10 tries, system responds with - Yeah, you are a champ!
